Before running the script,it is important that you have consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token,access_token_secret from Twitter. This information` can be found at Twitter Application Management Page. DO NOT hard code these information in your source code. You can put them in a file called 'file_name' and put 'file_name' onto the file '.gitignore' which you can create in your git repository. This will prevent your file 'file_name' from being uploaded. Or you can just export the these information to the environmental variable (in unix based systen export consumer_key='xxxx...' should do the trick).
